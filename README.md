### What is polymorphism?

When constructing applications, it is often the case that you will need to construct obejcts that share common methods or traits. Dancers, for example, all display individual unique traits, however they also share teh ability to dance, to stop dancing, and to line up. By creating dancers that are **_subclasses_** of a `Dancer` class, you can exhibit individuality while allowing your dancers to **_inherit_** useful methods from their **_superclass_**.
This ability of the `Dancer` class to manifest in various **_subclass_** forms is **_polymorphism_**.
